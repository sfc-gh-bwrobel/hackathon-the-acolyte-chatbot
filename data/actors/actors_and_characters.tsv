Amandla Stenberg as Verosha "Osha" and Mae-ho "Mae" Aniseya	Twin sisters who were separated by a tragedy when they were young. Osha is the former Padawan learner of Sol who left the Jedi Order due to "internal turmoil" she has regarding her connection to the Force. Mae is presumed dead until she re-emerges as a dangerous warrior using the dark side of the Force. Stenberg studied the Star Wars films and the online encyclopedia Wookieepedia in preparation for the series, and she wrote backstories for both her characters. She compared them to the concept of yin and yang: Mae represents the yin, with Stenberg describing her as intuitive and acting based on emotion; Osha represents the yang, with a more "masculine" façade hiding her fragility. Lauren Brady as young Osha, Leah Brady as young Mae
Lee Jung-jae as Sol A respected Jedi Master	Lee was surprised that creator Leslye Headland wanted him for the character based on his performance in Squid Game, feeling the two characters were very different. The series is Lee's first English language role, and he worked with two dialect coaches starting four months ahead of filming to be able to perform his lines. He took inspiration from previous Jedi Masters in the franchise, particularly Liam Neeson's performance as Qui-Gon Jinn, and worked with Headland to be specific about the character's emotions in each scene due to Sol having to balance a Jedi's control of emotions with his complicated feelings about Osha and Mae.
Charlie Barnett as Yord Fandar	A by-the-book Jedi Knight who aids Sol and Jecki.
Dafne Keen as Jecki Lon	Sol's current young Padawan. Jecki is half-human, half-Theelin just like Rystáll Sant, a background character from the 1997 special edition of the film Return of the Jedi (1983).
Rebecca Henderson as Vernestra Rwoh	A senior member of the Jedi Order who rose to prominence as a young prodigy
Jodie Turner-Smith as Mother Aniseya	The leader of a coven of Force witches who created Osha and Mae using the Force
Carrie-Anne Moss as Indara	A Jedi Master proficient in "Force-fu" fighting, who is killed by Mae at the start of the series. Headland wanted the audience to immediately feel that Indara was "the most powerful Jedi in the room". She was inspired by Moss's portrayal of Trinity in The Matrix film series when creating the character and intended for audiences to see Indara as "Trinity with a lightsaber". Headland felt the character's death set the tone for the series, established that Jedi can be killed, and indicated that audience assumptions about who is good and bad could be wrong. Moss bonded with Stenberg on set over their shared spiritual background.
Manny Jacinto as the Stranger	Mae's Sith master who initially disguises himself as a smuggler and apothecary named Qimir. He was inspired by the character Drunken Cat from the film Come Drink with Me (1966). The first-season finale reveals that he was previously the Jedi Padawan of Vernestra. Headland said the character's true name would be revealed in a potential second season and confirmed that he is now the apprentice of Sith lord Darth Plagueis.
Dean-Charles Chapman as Torbin	A Jedi Master who took the Barash Vow, floating in a silent state of Force meditation for over a decade. This vow was introduced in the Star Wars: Darth Vader comic book (2017).
Joonas Suotamo as Kelnacca	A Wookiee Jedi who lives a solitary life
Margarita Levieva as Mother Koril	A Zabrak witch who carried Osha and Mae
Harry Trevaldwyn as Mog	A Jedi who aides Vernestra
David Harewood as Rayencourt	A Republic senator who mistrusts the Jedi order
Thara Schöön as Tasi Lowa	Yord Fandar's Padawan
Derek Arnold as Ki-Adi-Mundi	a Jedi Master
Hassan Taj as Bazil	a Tynnan tracker who helps the Jedi. The Tynnans were introduced in the Star Wars Expanded Universe (EU) novel Han Solo's Revenge (1979).
A puppet as Jedi Master Yoda	A puppet. The season finale features brief cameo appearances from Jedi Master Yoda—portrayed using a puppet—and the Sith lord Darth Plagueis. Plagueis was first referenced in Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005) and further explored in EU works, but this series is the character's first on-screen appearance. The character is depicted to be a Muun, the species that he was established as in the EU.
