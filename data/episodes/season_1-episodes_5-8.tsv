5	"Night"	Alex Garcia Lopez	Kor Adana and Cameron Squires	June 25, 2024	Mae's master kills all the Jedi except Yord, Jecki, and Sol. Sol saves Osha from Mae’s master and demands that he reveal his identity. Mae's master claims that they have already met and then vanishes into the forest. Jecki captures Mae, but her master arrives to kill Mae for trying to betray him. Jecki breaks his brittle helmet before she is killed, revealing him to be Qimir. Sol arrives and questions Qimir, who says that “Qimir” is not his real name, but the Jedi might call him "Sith" and he now intends to kill them all to keep his existence secret. Yord ambushes Qimir, disarming him, but is quickly killed. Sol fights and overpowers Qimir but is stopped from killing him by Osha, who plants a light on Qimir that causes a colony of umbramoths to attack and carry him away. Mae uses Osha's stun gun on Sol so she can speak with Osha, but they end up arguing about each other's choices and Mae uses the Force to knock Osha unconscious. Mae steals Osha's clothes and poses as her sister, returning with Sol to the Jedi ship. They are followed by a suspicious Bazil. Qimir frees himself from the umbramoths and finds Osha lying unconscious in the forest.
6	"Teach / Corrupt"	Hanelle Culpepper	Leslye Headland and Jocelyn Bioh	July 2, 2024	Qimir takes Osha to an unknown planet where he dresses her wounds. He claims to be a former Jedi who was betrayed by his master, drawing parallels to Osha's past. She is wary of him, but eventually agrees to try on his repaired helmet, which is made from the lightsaber-blocking metal cortosis. On the Jedi ship at Khofar, interference disrupts Sol's attempts to contact the Jedi Council; a partial message about losing his whole team makes it to Coruscant. Sol asks Mae to help fix the ship's power, still believing her to be Osha, and she is attacked by Bazil. Mae overpowers him and resets the power. She tries to get Sol to tell her the truth about what happened on Brendok, but her wording reveals to him that she is not Osha. When the ship's power is restored, Sol stuns Mae and leaves with her just as Vernestra and a small band of Jedi arrive to investigate his message. They find the massacre and suspect that a fallen Jedi is responsible with the Jedi Mog suggesting that only Sol would be powerful enough to kill so many. When Mae wakes, Sol says he will tell her the truth about what happened on Brendok.
7	"Choice"	Kogonada	Charmaine DeGraté and Jen Richards & Jasmyne Flournoy	July 9, 2024	16 years earlier, the four Jedi discover the coven while investigating a potential "vergence" in the Force on Brendok, which could create life. The Jedi Council decides that the twins are too old and should be left with the coven, despite Osha's wish to become a Jedi; Koril stokes Mae's anger over Osha's decision, leading to Mae accidentally starting the fire. The results for the twins' "M-count", which shows their Force sensitivity, indicates that they were artificially created with a single consciousness split into two bodies. Torbin, eager to return to Coruscant, sees this as proof of the vergence and rushes to retrieve the girls. Sol follows and the pair confront the coven before Kelnacca and Indara arrive. Sol kills Aniseya when she attempts to use her power. The witches possess Kelnacca and use him to attack Torbin and Sol until Indara overpowers and kills them. Sol is unable to save both Mae and Osha from the burning fortress and chooses to save Osha. As they return to Coruscant, Indara decides to blame the incident on Mae's fire and not tell the council about Sol's actions so he can train Osha as his Padawan.
8	"The Acolyte"	Hanelle Culpepper	Jason Micallef	July 16, 2024	Sol takes Mae to Brendok and sends their location to the Jedi. Mae escapes Sol's ship on a pod with the help of a reprogrammed Pip. Sol gives chase but is unable to catch her. Meanwhile, Osha has a vision of Mae killing Sol and agrees to lead Qimir to her; a mysterious figure watches the pair depart.[a] In the ruins of the witches' fortress, Osha confronts Mae as Sol and Qimir fight. Mae disarms Sol after he defeats Qimir, but chooses to let him live so he can confess his crimes to the Jedi Council. Sol reveals that Mae and Osha are the same person, created through the vergence on Brendok, and admits to killing Aniseya. Osha angrily kills Sol using the Force, corrupting the kyber crystal in his lightsaber which turns from blue to red. She and Mae escape before Vernestra arrives with a group of Jedi and finds Sol's body. The sisters reconcile and Osha agrees to train with Qimir. He uses the Force to wipe Mae's memory. On Coruscant, the Senate grows weary of Jedi secrets and launches an investigation into the order. Vernestra blames the murders of Indara, Torbin, Kelnacca, and the witches on Sol, despite sensing Qimir's involvement. Qimir was once her apprentice, and she wants an amnesiac Mae's help to find him. Vernestra reports to a Jedi Master.
